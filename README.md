2 Literature Review
The literature surrounding predictive maintenance for aircraft engines is expansive,
reflecting the industry’s ongoing efforts to advance safety and operational
efficiency. Saxena et al.’s seminal work in 2008, "Damage Propagation Modeling
for Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation"(PHM08), stands as a
foundational cornerstone in the realm of prognostics and health management.
The research tackled the complexities of modeling damage propagation in aircraft
engines, offering insights into predicting failure modes and highlighting
the critical need for proactive maintenance strategies.
Saxena’s theoretical framework underscored the importance of understanding
degradation patterns and simulating run-to-failure scenarios. By linking
specific damage modes to engine health deterioration, the study set the stage
for subsequent research seeking to implement these theoretical concepts into
practical predictive maintenance applications.
Building upon Saxena’s foundational work, recent literature emphasizes
a paradigm shift toward data-driven approaches. The availability of datasets
like the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set on platforms
such as Kaggle has enabled researchers to bridge the gap between theory and
application. This dataset, curated by Behrad3d, stands out as a comprehensive
resource for simulating real-world engine degradation, providing a diverse range
of operational conditions and sensor readings.
Contemporary studies explore a spectrum of methodologies, from statistical
models to machine learning and deep learning approaches. The transition
from traditional statistical techniques to machine learning models reflects the
industry’s recognition of the power of data-driven insights. Ensemble learning
techniques, notably random forests, have gained prominence for their ability
to handle complex relationships within datasets. Similarly, the application of
neural networks, particularly in the form of deep learning, showcases the industry’s
push toward harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence in predictive
maintenance.
Furthermore, the literature indicates a growing focus on holistic feature
engineering. Beyond direct temperature readings, researchers are exploring the
integration of various sensor readings, operational conditions, and statistical
measures. The shift toward engineered features, including root mean square,
mean, median, sum, maximum, minimum, variance, and standard deviation,
reflects a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of engine health.
